    <p>uchronic mirror by alan perry in 2021 <br><br>
      a mirror that tells the time and reflects past versions of your physical space into a virtual one. inspired by cuckoo clocks and automata from the 13th-17th centuries. the title comes from a term first shared with me by eduardo kac meaning "non-time", from the greek "ou-chronos" meaning "not-time".<br><br>
